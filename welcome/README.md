# Welcome to EZ Node.js Examples
***

Thank you for stopping by my blog.  If you're here I'm assuming you might be looking one or more examples, maybe a tip or trick about how to do something in node.  If that's the case then you've come to the right place because that's why this blog has been created.  Take a look around, as I've created examples on a number of differnet topics on node from the very basics about how to get things installed and running, core node.js libraries, and also on high-level topics revolving around frameworks that have build built around node. 

If you can't find what your looking for please let me know.  I'll see if I can create a sample or example myself to help answer your question, and if that doesn't work or if I can't I'll do my best to point you in the right direction.

# Not so EZ
***

Yes the title of the blog is 'ez'node.jsexamples, but I really don't mean to say that node is easy.  Well, if you're an experienced noder and you're just checking out this site then it's probably easy for you.  But if you're new to node then there is nothing really easy about it.  Really I called it *ez* because my HOPE is that this blog will make node a little ezier .... for you. 

# Why this blog
***

I would be remiss and seriously lying if I told you that I created this blog for the simple, sole and only purpose of helping everyone out on node.  while that is partially true, like maybe 63% true, it is not the only reason. 

Truth is my background is really in Java and I myself am a relatively new noder.  I created this site partially because it also helps me to learn by taking notes and playing with examples. And I mean lots and lots of examples.  I am a 'learn by example' kind of guy for sure. In some ways, this blog is my notepad.  

That being said, I really do want to help out as well, and it is my sincere hope that the examples here will bootstrap and speed up your lewarning curve, if you are on a learning curve.

**Note**: If you are an advanced noder as well and have comments, suggestions, recommendatations, or even mabye a little *constructive* criticism, please let me know.  I'm not here to say that I'm the IT of node, I'm just a student and user like you.

# What to expect

Expect examples, lots of examples.

The format of this blog is simple, a series of examples.  The intent is to step through a number of topics, but to do it in a way that is actionable. Learn by doing, not just by read ---> that is the motto here. All the samples are posted on github also if you prefer to read and/or use the examples that way. 

The blog will cover a number of different topics, from the basics to more advanced, and it tends to cover the things that I've come across that is useful or essential.  It also covers things that I just find cool that I maybe read on another blog or a tip that I got from a friend or co-worker.  

And if you have any tips and examples, please share them.  I'm sure I could use the examples and so will our readers.  You'd be helping us all out.
